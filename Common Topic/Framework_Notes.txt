Framework Explanation
------------------------
The framework that we used in our project is based on the Design pattern called page object model . 
It is also extended version of Pattern object Model . in this design pattern 
we build the entire framework on top of the design pattern and we have a Structure to it, 
we use core java as programming language , we use maven as build tool , we are using apache poi to read the data from excel 
and we are using testng as a runner , 
selenium webdriver as our browser component to Interact with webApplication, in addition to that we  use cucumber for BDD framework..

Can you to explain to physical folder in our project?
   
                      we  have some  physical structure which we are using of.
our architecht will design the framework intially he starts building the design package in interface 
interface has unimplemented methods on that   mean time i have joined in this project before myjoinining my team mates has
devoleped the wrapper class. the wrapper class has design package where all unimplemented methods will be implemented from that.
in addition to this in the wrapper class where they have properly used exceptional handling.


 Hooks package Consists of different methods namely Testng ,Cucmber and  Annatations
Utility package is used to read the data from excel .Moreover it has extend report class which is used to generate the html report
(inorder to excute the testcases and it takes the screenshot of every methods)

in pom we have pages as a package in this package we have many implementation of pages,in this we will not opt for implementation pagefactory
since it is depricated therefore we are using regular X-path for regular pages packages which is followed by respective testcases
this is our folder structure our define inside java ..
     In addition to that source main property we also have properties files and xml files 
to root folder which constitude of our framework look like ..




Hierarchy of the classes in the framework:
------------------------------------------
AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
	DriverInstance
		Reporter
			SeleniumBase
				ProjectSpecificMethods
					Testcases & Pages	
					
					
Execution of any testcase will follow TestNG annotations					
					
@BeforeSuite					-> startReport() (Reporter)
	@BeforeTest					-> setValues() (Testcase)
		@BeforeClass			-> startTestCase() (Reporter)		
			@DataProvider		-> fetchData() (ProjectSpecificMethods)
				@BeforeMethod	-> preCondition() (ProjectSpecificMethods)
					@Test		-> Testcase
				@AfterMethod	-> postCondition() (ProjectSpecificMethods)
		@AfterClass 			-> NA
	@AfterTest 					-> NA
@AfterSuite						-> endResult() (Reporter)
