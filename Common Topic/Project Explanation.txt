*Elicheck Journey – Interview*

Paragraph

"In the Elicheck Journey, my work focused on the eligibility stage of the lending flow, where new customers like NTF or NTB users enter 
their account details to check if they qualify for a personal loan. This journey validates key fields such as sort code, 
account number, and how long the customer has held the account, and then generates a loan decision. I tested the entire flow from input 
validations to the 'Our Decision' page, ensuring the loan amount, monthly repayment, and total payable were displayed accurately and aligned with the
 updated UI designs. I also validated the Edit Loan functionality, where customers can adjust their loan amount and tenure before finalizing the offer.
 This journey is crucial because it determines whether a customer can proceed with a full application, so my focus was on accuracy, data validation, branding 
consistency, and a smooth customer experience."


Overpayment Journey – Interview

Paragraph

"In the Overpayment Journey, I tested the experience for existing loan customers who want to make an extra payment toward their loan to reduce 
the outstanding balance, future interest, or loan duration. This journey involves several flow types like Happy Path, Arrears Flow, No Direct Debit, 
and DXC Offline scenarios across brands such as Lloyds, Halifax, BOS, and MBNA. My responsibilities included validating the interstitial screens -like 
Checking Loan, Getting Account Details, and Making Payment ensuring the right information was shown at each step. I also verified Adobe Analytics tagging, 
where each journey step had to correctly fire events for tracking, such as 'Journey Step Name', 'Step Number', and 'Journey Status'. I performed UI, functional, 
and analytics validation to make sure the Overpayment flow was error-free, brand-consistent, and accurately captured customer behaviour for reporting."



Early Settlement Journey - Interview

Paragraph

"In the Early Settlement Journey, I was responsible for validating the process where a customer chooses to close their loan early by paying the full 
settlement amount. This journey calculates the outstanding balance, interest up to the settlement date, and any applicable fees. I tested scenarios such 
as DD near-due dates, holiday shifts, quote retrieval accuracy, and API error handling to ensure the settlement amount shown to customers was correct. On 
the Settlement Quote Page, I validated the redesigned Ul, tooltips explaining how calculations work, and brand-specific layouts for Halifax, Lloyds, and BOS. 
I also tested the payment flow, confirmation screens, and edge-case behaviours like missing quote data or invalid API responses. This journey directly impacts 
financial accuracy and regulatory compliance, so I ensured all calculations and displays were fully correct and aligned with backend rules."


Combined Project Explanation Paragraph (Elicheck + Overpayment + Early Settlement)


"In my current role, I have been involved in testing three major servicing journeys-Elicheck, Overpayment, and Early Settlement across 
multiple brands like Lloyds, Halifax, BOS, and MBNA. In the Elicheck Journey, I validated the entire eligibility flow for NTB/NTF customers, 
including account-level validations, decision accuracy, updated Ul content, and the Edit Loan functionality. In the Overpayment Journey, I tested
 scenarios where customers make an extra payment toward their loan, covering multiple flows such as Happy Path, Arrears, and No Direct Debit. I validated 
the interstitial screens, payment behaviour, and Adobe Analytics tagging to ensure every step fired correct journey events. In the Early Settlement Journey, 
I verified the settlement quote calculations, interest breakdown, DD-near-due scenarios, and holiday shift logic, ensuring financial accuracy and compliance.
 Across all three journeys, my focus has been on functional correctness, data accuracy, cross-brand consistency, Ul alignment, API validations, and providing a 
smooth customer experience end-to-end."
